# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm. It works by checking each item in the list that is going to be ordered with the next one, swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

#### Install Package:

```npm
$ npm install bubblesort-algorithm
```

---

#### How it Works?:

Function receives a disordered Array:  
 Ej: [1, 9, 5, 2, 10, 6, 3, 7, 8, 4]

```
const bubbleSort = require("bubblesort-algorithm");

let array = [1, 9, 5, 2, 10, 6, 3, 7, 8, 4];

bubbleSort(array);
console.log(array);
```
